# Security Checklist ✅

## Environment Variables Secured

- ✅ `.env.local` - Contains real keys (local development only)
- ✅ `.env` - Contains placeholders only
- ✅ `.env.example` - Contains placeholders only
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes sensitive files

## Files Safe for Git

- ✅ No real API keys in committed files
- ✅ Documentation uses placeholders
- ✅ Build configuration is secure

## Deployment Security

- ✅ Environment variables must be set manually in Netlify dashboard
- ✅ Real keys are never committed to repository
- ✅ Local development uses `.env.local` (auto-ignored by git)

## ⚠️ Remember

1. **Never commit** `.env.local` or files with real keys
2. **Always use** environment variables in production
3. **Copy real values** from `.env.local` to Netlify dashboard manually

Your project is now secure for deployment! 🔒
